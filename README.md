# The W3C Dataspaces Community Group

This is the repository for W3C Community Group on dataspaces. 

We invite you to participate in identifying and proposing challenges in the area of dataspaces.
Both basic scientific research and practical experience are welcome.
These challenges will help the dataspace community in several ways: 
Understanding pain points, building consensus, propose solutions, and shape future work.

Please use the [issue template](https://github.com/w3c-cg/dataspaces/issues/new/choose) to submit a challenge, or browse to the existing challenges in [the issues](https://github.com/w3c-cg/dataspaces/issues)

The challenges were a [potent input](roadmap-process-2024-2025.svg) for the call for papers for the [2025 Semantics in Dataspaces Workshop](https://dbis.rwth-aachen.de/SDS25/), held in conjunction with [ESWC 2025](https://2025.eswc-conferences.org/).

If youâ€™d like to support / join the community group and subscribe to the mailing list, [visit our community group page at W3C](https://www.w3.org/community/dataspaces/).
