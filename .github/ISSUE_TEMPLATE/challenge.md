## Challenge Description
<!--
Provide a detailed description of the problem, including the context and specific pain points faced by the community.

Example:
- Users like to be addressed by their preferred name within apps.
  - This is a name that they are known as or use for themselves.
- In some cultures, this is the first name.
  - It could also be a user-chosen name or nickname.
- Other cultures do not have the concept of a first name, so another strategy is needed.

## Impact and Importance
<!--
Explain why this challenge is significant for the dataspaces community and what impact solving it would have.

Example:
- Personalized user experience increases user satisfaction and engagement.
- Addressing cultural diversity in names makes the app more inclusive.
- Solutions can be applied to other areas of the application.
-->

## Desired Solution
<!--
Provide insights on how the solution should/could look like. Be as specific as possible.

Example:
- Encode the rules for arriving at the preferred name in a declarative way.
  - For instance, using reasoning rules.
- Expose the functionality via JavaScript
  - For instance, through `getUserPreferredName` or `user.preferredName`
-->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!--
Describe the criteria for a contribution that needs to be provided for the solution to be accepted.

Example:
- I want to see an example app with a user bar at the top right.
- This user bar shows a profile picture and "Hi, Alex".
  - Here, "Alex" is the logged-in user's preferred name.
- This demo should work for people from different backgrounds.
  - People without a first name
  - People with a nickname
  - People with a chosen name
